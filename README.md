## General Information
- The project aims to predict housing prices using machine learning techniques.
- The dataset contains various features related to residential properties, such as area, amenities, and condition, along with the corresponding sale prices.
- The business problem addressed by this project is to provide accurate predictions of housing prices to facilitate informed decision-making for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.

## Conclusions
- Lasso regression, with an alpha of 0.0001, emerged as the preferred model for its superior performance and feature selection capabilities.
- Features such as OverallQual, GrLivArea, and Neighborhood were identified as significant predictors of housing prices.
- The project successfully addressed data preprocessing, model selection, and feature engineering to create a robust predictive model for housing prices.
